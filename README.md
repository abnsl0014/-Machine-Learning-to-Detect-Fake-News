# -Machine-Learning-to-Detect-Fake-News
Worked on 2 different fake news related data set using machine learning algorithms and classified fake or real news based on the training figures. Dataset sizes were 500 and 15000 news. By keeping in mind certain factors, detected the accuracies of algorithms to differentiate which dataset is more useful. The scope of this project could be helpful in predicting whether the dataset can provide resourceful results for further predictions.
